          <p>Webpage designed to imitate the look of wikipedia's homepage. Using bootsrap rows and columns, the page is organized into sections similar to those on wikipedia.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>I'm a current student at Epicodus, in the track that teaches C#, JavaScript, and .NET programming. My first introduction to coding was at <a href="https://votesmart.org">VoteSmart.org</a> where I used SQL to manage special interest group data. It was amazing that I could create queries to find patterns and useful metrics out of a sea of words and numbers. Since leaving Vote Smart and before starting Epicodus, I completed a few courses on <a href="https://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>, including classes on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For more information, check out <a href="img/resume.pdf">my resume</a>.</p>

      <h4>Interests</h4>

        <li>Revisiting classic and popular books that a high school literature class might require</li>
        <li>Games of all sorts: card games, sports, board games,e tc.</li>
