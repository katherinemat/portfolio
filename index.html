        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h4 class="text-uppercase">Background</h4>
        <p>I'm a current student at Epicodus, in the track that teaches C#, JavaScript, and .NET programming. My first introduction to coding was at <a href="https://votesmart.org">VoteSmart.org</a> where I used SQL to manage special interest group data. It was amazing that I could create queries to find patterns and useful metrics out of a sea of words and numbers. Since leaving Vote Smart and before starting Epicodus, I completed a few courses on <a href="https://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>, including classes on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
